Chapter 4: Composite Types

Arrays and structs are aggregate types; their values are concatenations of other values in memory. 

Arrays are homogeneous—their elements all have the same type—whereas structs are
heterogeneous. 

Both arrays and structs are fixed size. In contrast, slices and maps are
dynamic data structures that grow as values are added.
